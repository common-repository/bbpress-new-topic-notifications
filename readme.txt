== Description ==

**This plugin is for bbPress 2.x**

Many people who run forums would like to know when a new topic (thread) has been posted but do not have the time to constantly check their forum for activity. This solves that!

This plugin will send an e-mail notification to specific addresses when a new topic has been posted. The users who receive notification along with a simple e-mail template is configured in the bbPress settings.

**Note**: The current stable version of this plugin is 1.1. If you download it through the WordPress repo you will get version 1.1. However, there is a new beta version 1.2 that you can use and test if you choose. Version 1.2 adds  notifications for topic replies.

If you would like to try 1.2 you can grab it from trunk (plugin repo) or download it from GitHub - https://github.com/jaredatch/bbPress-New-Topic-Notifications/zipball/master

If you download 1.2, please report any errors or any success to the support forums. 1.2 should be fairly stable, however I have not had enough people test it for me to push it out to everyone.
